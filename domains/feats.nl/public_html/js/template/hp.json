Fringe is a FREE festival!    </p>    <p>        The FEATS Fringe offers a chance for groups to perform something that doesn't necessarily fit the main Festival's        requirements.        Any group can offer a performance which does not have to be a play - singers are always welcome, and one year we        even had jugglers!        This year, we're offering a range of plays. The Fringe always ends with the FEATS Skit, where various happenings        during        the Festival are given the publicity they deserve.    </p>    <h3>Running order</h3>    <strong>Saturday, 18 May</strong>    <ul>        <li>IN Players - Dark Lady of the Sonnets</li>        <li>AATG - Earwig</li>        <li>Lucerne - World Theatre Company - Bollywood Brides</li>    </ul>    </p>    <p>        <strong>Sunday, 19 May</strong>    <ul>        <li>ESOC -The Way of All Fish</li>        <li>IN Players - Vincent</li>        <li>Stockholm - Theatre Workshop</li>    </ul>    </p>    <p>        <strong>Monday, 20 May</strong>    <ul>        <li>FEATS Committee - FEATS Forum</li>        <li>Hamburg - Baby Food</li>        <li>Martin Kirk & Friends - FEATS Skit</li>    </ul>    </p>",
