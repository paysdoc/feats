<p>This year, we do not have any ‘block bookings’ in hotels for FEATS visitors and participants;
    the best deals are available online, but here are a few of our suggestions. More hotels can be
    found on www.denhaag.nl. The Hague has many different hotels in and around the city centre
    – so, have a look around.</p>
<p>The ‘TI: links’ (Tourist Information links ) bring you to the Tourist Information Office site.
    Booking through this site might provide you with cheaper deals than by booking through the
    hotel’s own website.
    The approximate walking distance to/from the Koninklijke Schouwburg (where FEATS 2013
    will be held) is given.</p>
