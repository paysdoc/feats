    (upstairs in the KS theatre building).<br/>

    Never been to Fringe before? Why not give it a try? Fringe is a FREE festival!
</p>
<p>
    The FEATS Fringe offers a chance for groups to perform something that doesn't necessarily fit the main Festival's
    requirements.
    Any group can offer a performance which does not have to be a play - singers are always welcome, and one year we
    even had jugglers!
    This year, we're offering a range of plays. The Fringe always ends with the FEATS Skit, where various happenings
    during
    the Festival are given the publicity they deserve.
