       </p><p>
    FEATS has been an inspiration to European English-speaking amateur dramatic societies since its inception. It is an annual opportunity to showcase, in one place, over 4 nights, a diverse range of English-language plays presented by groups from all over Europe.
</p><p>
    We are extremely lucky this year to once again be holding the festival in the magnificent Koninklijke Schouwburg, a centrepiece of theatrical excellence in The Netherlands. The facilities offered by this theatre are truly magnificent.
</p><p>
    If you are a visitor to FEATS and want to know about your stay; how to book tickets, how to book hotels, travel information and general information about The Hague then click on the ‘Audience’ button.
</p><p>
    If you are one of the participating groups, the important information for you can be seen when you click on ‘Groups’ button.
</p><p>
    Some plays will amuse you, some will challenge you, and some may even shock you, but with such a varied selection being presented, I am confident you will end each day, having had a fantastic evening’s entertainment.
