<img src="/img/poster.jpg"/><div><h2>A Welcome From The Chairman</h2><p>It is with great pleasure that I welcome you all to this year’s FEATS, a festival of English spoken plays
    hosted by the Anglo American Theatre Group (AATG) in the Hague.
    </p><p>
    FEATS, standing for Festival of European Anglophone Societies, has been an inspiration to European
    English speaking amateur dramatic societies since its inception. It is an annual opportunity to
    showcase, in one place, over 4 nights, a diverse range of English language plays presented by groups
    originating far and wide within Europe, but all bound together by their love of English spoken
    theatre.
</p><p>
    We are extremely lucky this year to once again be holding the festival in the magnificent Konlijke
    Schouwburg theatre, a centrepiece of theatrical excellence within the Netherlands, being a place
    able to provide a warm welcome to both the audience and the performing groups. The facilities
    offered by this theatre are truly magnificent!
</p><p>
    As you can see, the website for FEATS 2013 is now ’live’ and is packed with practical information on
    all aspects of the festival.
</p><p>
    If you are one of the participating groups and want information regarding the staging of your play,
    deadlines, questionnaires or what actually happens on the ‘big day’ then click on ‘ groups’.
</p><p>
    If you are a visitor to FEATS and want to know about your stay; how to book tickets, how to book
    hotels, travel information and general information about the Hague then click on ‘Audience’ .
</p><p>
    Don’t miss this opportunity to experience a truly unique festival.
</p><p>
    Some plays will amuse you; some will challenge you, and some may even shock you, but with such
    a varied selection being presented, I am confident you will end each day, having had a fantastic
    evening’s entertainment.
